Heyy, it's me, this is my first blog post here. I will be sharing my thoughts, ideas, and experiences here. I hope you enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them. 

### Why not just use Medium or other platforms?
I just want to have my own space, I also find it more productive to be writing inside VsCode or any other text editor using markdown files, you can also make changes in case you find something wrong, like a major update in some language/tech that could break the code, etc.

### What will I be writing about?
I will be writing about my experiences, my thoughts, and my ideas. I will also be writing about my projects, and how I built them. I'm planning to start indie hacking so I will be writing about that too, so stay tunned.

### Follow me
You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bjwassim), [Github](https://github.com/wassimbj), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wassimbenjdida). and you can find the code of this website [here](https://github.com/wassimbj/wassimbj.github.io).
